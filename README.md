# Tudor Craft
This is a simple tudor mod made for a school project. We have tried to make it as accurate as possible while still having a few easter eggs as well! We hope you enjoy! Please also note that this is only a small project and as of right now does not have much content. Since we have only one artist, one dev and one builder, please try not tooverload us with feature requests! Feel free to contribute if you wish to, but it might take me a while to update this README.md file and add your name, so feel free to do so in the commit!
## Contributers

- Mr Thorpe, our history teacher, who let us do this project for homework!
